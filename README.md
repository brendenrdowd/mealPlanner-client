# Nutrionist 
Nutrionist allows users to find and save recipes to their calendar. A live version can be found at [mealplan.now.sh](https://mealplan.now.sh/) 

## Motivation
I have a hard time grocery shopping effectively and cooking meals for myself. I wanted a centralized way to find recipes based on ingredients and consolidate it into a calendar so a user can know exactly whats for dinner coming up and what ingredients they will need. 

### Spoonacular API
Currently I'm relying heavily on the RapidAPI spoonacular API. My hope is to integrate with a user interactive database and stop relying on the external API altogether. 

### Future Features
This is a project I will continue to work on,  my main goals are:
  - Add a consolidated grocery list
  - Allow users to update their information, i.e. diets, allergies and password. 
  - Allow users to favorite recipes and get recommendations based on favorites.
